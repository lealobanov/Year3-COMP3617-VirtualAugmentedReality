In the Unity project, each problem is contained within a separate scene.

To launch the first scene, navigate to Assets > Scenes > Problem 1.

Once running the scene, a UI facilitates modifying material parameters (e.g. C values, RGB channel offsets, mesh complexity, toggling inverse distortion functionality). The UI panel can be toggled by pressing on the wrench icon in the lower left hand corner of the screen. A dropdown located at the top-right of the UI panel enables you to switch between scenes for problems 1,2, and 3.
